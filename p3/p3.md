### Difference between K3S and K3D

| Feature            | K3s                                           | K3d                                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Lightweight Kubernetes distribution          | Tool for running K3s clusters within Docker containers |
| Deployment         | Suitable for production and resource-constrained environments | Primarily for local development and testing            |
| Resource Usage     | Optimized for minimal resource consumption   | Uses Docker containers for isolation                    |
| Deployment Method  | Typically deployed directly on machines or VMs | Runs K3s clusters within Docker containers             |
| Use Cases          | Edge computing, IoT, CI/CD pipelines         | Local development, testing, prototyping                |
| Dependencies       | Minimal dependencies; often deployed with a single binary | Requires Docker for containerization                   |
| Ease of Management | Simplified deployment and management          | Easily create and manage multiple local clusters       |
| Scalability        | Suitable for scaling in resource-constrained environments | Primarily used for local development, not for large-scale production |
